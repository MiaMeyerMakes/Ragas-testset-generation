What happen on Zoom?,"['Skills and Behaviors of allies\n\nTo be an effective ally it is important to understand some of the skills and behaviors great allies exhibit.\n\nActive listening\n\nNeutral and nonjudgmental.\n\nPatient (periods of silence are not ""filled"")\n\nVerbal and nonverbal feedback to show signs of listening (e.g., smiling, eye contact, leaning in, mirroring)\n\nAsking questions.\n\nReflecting back what is said.\n\nAsking for clarification.\n\nSummarizing.\n\nEmpathy & Emotional Intelligence\n\nAn example of this could be: A colleague comes to you and tells you that their pronouns are being misused often at work and it is making them feel uncomfortable and they are avoiding social calls and interactions. Whilst you haven’t experienced this yourself and unlikely you would experience this, you allow yourself to think of situations where you have felt uncomfortable at work before. You also put yourself consciously into the shoes of your colleague and think of a way you can practically help. You offer to your colleague that in the next 5 calls they participate in you will be on the call and actively point out misuse of their pronouns to other colleagues to take away some of the emotional burden.\n\nActive learning about other experiences\n\nYou go beyond performative actions for example black squares on Instagram for Black Lives Matter, but actively does the work to understand the pain, struggle and experience of those burdened.\n\nThis could look like: You are managing black team members, an incident has occurred externally that could affect the mental health of those team members. You actively research the experience and historical context of the trauma associated with the incident. You use this to ensure you are informed and able to appropriately apply empathy if a team member approaches you to ask for assistance.\n\nHumility\n\nNon-defensive\n\nWillingness to take on feedback\n\nYou aren’t going to get it right all the time and you have to be ok with that. Be willing to take feedback on and not let it deter you from continuing to be an ally.\n\nExample of this could be: You are in a safe space with an underrepresented group acting as an ally and absorbing information. A point comes up that you are passionate about and you talk over someone in the group and take over the conversation. After the meeting someone from the group jumps on a Zoom meeting with you and explains that it felt you took away the viewpoints of a number of people from the URG because you took over the conversation and interrupted an individual. You apologize, take on the feedback, ask for any tips on how to make sure it doesn’t happen again and take the necessary steps. --- One of the mistakes that often happens here is being defensive or justifying the action. The group will already know you are operating with good intent but generally are wanting to help you level up in their lived experience.\n\nCourage\n\nComfortable getting uncomfortable\n\nSpeak up where others don\'t or can\'t\n\nThe empathy example is also a good example of this.\n\nSelf-awareness\n\nOwn and use your privilege\n\nThis could look like: You are in a product meeting and the meeting will be making critical decisions about the product roadmap for the next three months and you notice that everyone in the meeting is of the same gender and race. You use your privileged situation in the meeting to point this out and ask the people in the meeting. Who should be invited to ensure we are getting a diverse perspective and viewpoint on the agenda items for the meeting?\n\nAction orientated\n\nYou see something, you say something\n\nThe example above is a good example of this: Ensure decisions and conversations have diverse voices. I.E. you are in a meeting and everyone looks the same, insist on other perspectives.\n\nIn a group setting when a discussion or comment is verbalized that could be controversial use language similar to this to course correct the conversation:\n\n""I would like us all to be aware of our language and/or acknowledgements and ensure we are being respectful to all individuals. Thank you.""\n\n""I am practicing being an ally and as a reminder I would like to ensure we are all using inclusive language""\n\n']",After the meeting someone from the group jumps on a Zoom meeting with you and explains that it felt you took away the viewpoints of a number of people from the URG because you took over the conversation and interrupted an individual.,single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
What is the purpose of the Ally Lab Learning Group?,"['Tips on being an ally Identifying your power and privilege helps you act as an ally more effectively Follow and support those as much as possible from marginalized groups When you make a mistake, apologize, correct yourself, and move on Allies spend time educating themselves and use the knowledge to help Allies take the time to think and analyze the situation Allies try to understand Perception vs. Reality Allies don’t stop with their power they also leverage others powers of authority See our Ally Resources Page for more resources on being an ally. Allyship & Empathy Being an Ally Requires Empathy {{< youtube ""1Evwgu369Jw"" >}} Responding with Empathy What to say, when you don’t know what to say: Acknowledgement of their pain. “I’m sorry you are going through this.” “That must be hard.” Share how you feel. “Wow. I don’t know what to say.” “It makes me really sad to hear this happened.” Show Gratitude that the person opened up. “Thank you for sharing with me.” “This must be hard to talk about. Thanks for opening up to me.” Show Interest. “How are you feeling about everything?” “Is there anything else you want to share?” Be Encouraging. “You are brave / strong / talented.” “You matter.” Be Supportive. “I’m here for you.” “I’m happy to listen any time.” Boot and Sandal Methophor Imagine you are wearing a heavy boot (represents privilege) and you are stepping on someone’s foot that is only wearing sandals (represents oppression). If someone says, “Ouch, you are stepping on my toes!” How do you react? Problems with common responses to mistakes become obvious: Centering the mistake around yourself: “I can’t believe you think I’m a toe-stepper! I’m a good person!” Denial that others’ experiences are different from your own: “I don’t mind when people step on my toes.” Derailing: “Some people don’t even have toes, why aren’t we talking about them instead?” Refusal to center the impacted: “All toes matter!” Tone policing: “I’d move my foot if you’d ask me more nicely.” Denial that the problem is fixable: “Toes getting stepped on is a fact of life. You’ll be better off when you accept that.” Victim blaming: “You shouldn’t have been walking around people with boots!” Withdrawing: “I thought you wanted my help, but I guess not. I’ll just go home.” Instead, you would respond with the following: Center the impacted: “Are you okay?” Listen to their response and learn. Apologize for the impact, even though you didn’t intend it: “I’m sorry!” Stop the instance: move your foot Stop the pattern: be careful where you step in the future. When it comes to oppression, we want to actually change the “footwear” to get rid of privilege and oppression (sneakers for all!), but metaphors can only stretch so far!

How can managers effectively incorporate DIB initiatives into their team meetings and what role do DIB roundtables play in fostering an inclusive work environment?,"['<1-hop>\n\ntitle: ""Roundtables"" description: On this page you will be provided an overview of our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Roundtables.\n\nA DIB roundtable is a great way to build deeper connections with team members and develop safe spaces to discuss DIB related issues. The DIB roundtable will ask team members to share stories and anecdotes as well as challenge team members to think about how they personally and collectively can positively impact DIB.\n\nWe have two avenues for DIB Roundtables:\n\n DIB Programmed Roundtables - The DIB Team creates a programmed roundtable(s) on a quarterly basis to discuss a pre-defined topic.\n\n Self-Organized - A TMRG, Team Members, Managers can organized a roundtable to discuss DIB related issues.\n\nStarting a roundtable\n\nDiversity, Inclusion & Belonging Team Programmed\n\nThe DIB Team will organize DIB Roundtables on a quarterly basis with a maximum of two roundtables in a quarter.\n\nThe DIB Team will program the quarterly roundtable on the team calendar when the decision has been made on the topics for the quarter\n\nThe DIB team will create an agenda with a series of questions for the quarterly roundtable\n\nThe roundtable will last 50mins and be split as followed:\n\n10mins: DIB Facilitator will set the topic and provide some context\n\n30mins: The DIB Facilitator will divide the group into small groups of 5/6 team members to discuss the questions in the agenda\n\n10mins: Debrief\n\nThe DIB Team will ask for a volunteer or are elect group facilitator for each group, your role is to:\n\nVerbalize the questions\n\nEnsure that everyone, including yourself gets an opportunity to contribute\n\nShare your screen where necessary i.e. slides or tasks\n\nProgrammed Roundtables:\n\nDate & Times Subject DIB Facilator TMRG (if applicatble) TBC Allyship Liam McNally N/A TBC Bias Liam McNally N/A TBC Microaggressions TBC NA\n\nSelf-organized\n\nFirst, identify a group of team members who would like to participate.

Seeing you in attendance also opens the door to future conversations that might begin with: ""I saw you in XYZ meeting, what did you think of such-and-such topic?""\n\nIncorporate DIB into your team meetings\n\nConnecting to team members is key to understand who they are and what they bring to the team. A great initial step is to start with open discussions. You could start by opening your next team meeting to chat about what they feel inclusion looks like, what is important to them as a team to feel included, etc. This could then move into monthly or quarterly team DIB icebreakers, trainings, etc. The idea is to make sure DIB is not touched on once and never mentioned again, but more of an understood aspect of your team environment. You can do this by setting and communicating DIB goals for your team, and sharing how we will measure success (an idea could be sharing DIB survey data with team members).\n\nEncourage Diversity of Thought and Speaking Up\n\nDon’t assume you know more than others. Give people a chance to add their perspective or expertise. Teach people how to disagree, set the expectation that it is OK to disagree, and encourage people to do it day-to-day. Celebrate diverse thoughts and thank people for making contributions, particularly if they disagree with you. It takes courage to disagree publicly with a leader.\n\nConnect with your team members\n\nTo help team members feel comfortable being themselves, leaders should consider authentic ways to connect to their team members. Everyone wants to feel visible and included in order to perform their best work. Being visible usually includes being seen for accomplishments, acknowledgment of contributions, what is the same, and what differs from team member to team member. Leaders and all team members should show an interest in and respect for differences and contributions.\n\nConsiderations could be that of language/terminology such as “spouses” or “partners” instead of making assumptions about team members sexual orientation. Being considerate of dietary restrictions when choosing food options for Contribute or other local gatherings. Acknowledging birthdays, recalling personal things that might have been mentioned in past calls such as moving to a new home, an ill family member or team member, and following up authentically.\n\nFor more information see our Inclusive Language.\n\nAsk employees what pronouns they use\n\nPronouns are a large piece of a person\'s identity and are often used to communicate a person’s gender, which is why it is so important to get it right. Asking for a person\'s pronouns and using those pronouns consistently shows that you respect their identity, but it also helps to create a more welcoming, safe, and supportive environment where people can feel comfortable being themselves. This is a change that goes a long way to foster inclusion.\n\nBe mindful of the times of your meetings\n\nIt\'s important to consider global times and alternating meetings to accommodate regions. Be mindful of families, commitments, observances, holidays, and meeting times that may be out of team members\' working hours. Every meeting time won\'t be perfect for everyone (which is why all meetings have an agenda), but making a conscious effort to alternate times is to ensure the same people aren\'t being excluded. For more, view our Inclusive Meetings operating principle.\n\nBe a Role Model\n\nAs a manager, you are in a unique position to model good DIB practices for the rest of your team. Be authentic, own up to mistakes, and commit to doing better next time. Don’t dwell on it. Set a good example by admitting that you make mistakes and invite people to help you and each other by speaking up in accordance with our feedback guidelines. By holding each other accountable, we get better as a team.\n\n']","Managers can effectively incorporate DIB initiatives into their team meetings by setting aside time to attend planned DIB events, which validates their importance and opens the door to future conversations. They should incorporate DIB into team meetings by starting open discussions about inclusion, setting DIB goals, and sharing success measures such as DIB survey data. Encouraging diversity of thought and speaking up is crucial, as is connecting authentically with team members to make them feel visible and included. DIB roundtables play a significant role in fostering an inclusive work environment by providing safe spaces for team members to discuss DIB-related issues, share stories, and challenge each other to positively impact DIB. These roundtables can be programmed by the DIB Team or self-organized by team members, offering structured opportunities for engagement and discussion.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
